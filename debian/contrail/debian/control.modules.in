Description: OpenContrail VRouter - precompiled module version
 The OpenContrail vRouter is a forwarding plane (of a distributed router) that
 runs in the hypervisor of a virtualized server. It extends the network from the
 physical routers and switches in a data center into a virtual overlay network
 hosted in the virtualized servers. The OpenContrail vRouter is
 conceptually similar to existing commercial and open source vSwitches such as
 for example the Open vSwitch (OVS) but it also provides routing and higher
 layer services (hence vRouter instead of vSwitch).
 .
 This package contains the someproject loadable kernel modules for the
 linux-image-_KVERS_ package.
