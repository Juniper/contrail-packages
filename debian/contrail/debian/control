Description: OpenContrail analytics
 Analytics nodes are responsible for collecting, collating and presenting
 analytics information for trouble shooting problems and for understanding
 network usage. Each component of the OpenContrail System generates detailed
 event records for every significant event in the system. These event records
 are sent to one of multiple instances (for scale-out) of the analytics node
 that collate and store the information in a horizontally scalable database
 using a format that is optimized for time-series analysis and queries. The
 analytics nodes have mechanism to automatically trigger the collection of more
 detailed records when certain event occur; the goal is to be able to get to the
 root cause of any issue without having to reproduce it. The analytics nodes
 provide a north-bound analytics query REST API.
 .
 Analytics nodes collect, store, correlate, and analyze information from
 network elements, virtual or physical. This information includes statistics,
 logs, events, and errors.

Description: OpenContrail configuration management
 Configuration nodes are responsible for the management layer. The
 configuration nodes provide a north-bound Representational State Transfer
 (REST) Application Programming Interface (API) that can be used to configure
 the system or extract operational status of the system. The instantiated
 services are represented by objects in a horizontally scalable database that is
 described by a formal service data model (more about data models later on). The
 configuration nodes also contain a transformation engine (sometimes referred to
 as a compiler) that transforms the objects in the high-level service data model
 into corresponding more lower-level objects in the technology data model.
 Whereas the high-level service data model describes what services need to be
 implemented, the low-level technology data model describes how those services
 need to be implemented. The configuration nodes publish the contents of the
 low-level technology data model to the control nodes using the Interface for
 Metadata Access Points (IF-MAP) protocol.
 .
 Configuration nodes keep a persistent copy of the intended configuration state
 and translate the high-level data model into the lower level model suitable for
 interacting with network elements. Both these are kept in a NoSQL database.

Description: OpenContrail control-node
 Control nodes implement the logically centralized portion of the control
 plane. Not all control plane functions are logically centralized – some control
 plane functions are still implemented in a distributed fashion on the physical
 and virtual routers and switches in the network. The control nodes use the
 IF-MAP protocol to monitor the contents of the low-level technology data model
 as computed by the configuration nodes that describes the desired state of the
 network. The control nodes use a combination of south-bound protocols to “make
 it so”, i.e. to make the actual state of the network equal to the desired state
 of the network. In the initial version of the OpenContrail System these
 south-bound protocols include Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP)
 to control the OpenContrail vRouters as well as a combination of the Border
 Gateway Protocol (BGP) and the Network Configuration (Netconf) protocols to
 control physical routers. The control nodes also use BGP for state
 synchronization amongst each other when there are multiple instances of the
 control node for scale-out and high-availability reasons.
 .
 Control nodes implement a logically centralized control plane that is
 responsible for maintaining ephemeral network state. Control nodes interact
 with each other and with network elements to ensure that network state is
 eventually consistent.
